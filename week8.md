# Coding Assignment Guidelines

## Purpose

The purpose of each coding assignment is to help you master the concepts presented each week by answering problems using those concepts.

## Due Date

Each Coding Assignment is due by midnight on Saturday.

## Late Policy

Assignments turned in late will result in a 10% deduction of points.

## Tips

- Start the assignment early in the week and before your live class.
- Bring questions to your class, to office hours, or a mentor session.
- Be sure to follow all instructions as there are no resubmissions or regrades.

## Instructions

1. In Visual Studio Code, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below and ensures that the code compiles and runs as directed.
2. Comment your code, to prove that you understand what you have written -- this is required!
3. Create a new repository on GitHub for this week's assignments and push your code to the repository.
4. Record and upload a video showcasing your assignment.
5. Keep track of the URLs for this week's GitHub repository and video upload.
6. Start the quiz to submit your assignment.
   - Put the URL for your GitHub repo into the Quiz.
   - Put the URL for your video into the Quiz.
7. Answer the questions.

## Coding Steps

Create a menu app as seen in this weekâ€™s video. What you create is up to you as long as it meets the following requirements:

- Use at least one array.
- Use at least two classes.
- Your menu should have the options to create, view, and delete elements.

## Video Steps

1. Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.
2. This video should be done using screen share and voice over. This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend.
3. You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording. This will create a video recording on your computer.
4. This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube. Ensure the link you share is **PUBLIC** or **UNLISTED**!
5. If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.
